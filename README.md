# Calculating-Sum-Average-from-Excel-file
This program written in the C language was created by me with notes in the code to demonstrate how you can retrieve information from an excel (or any file) and calculate different things based on what is in the file.

The file I used was just a really simple idea I created, you could take this base code and information and really dig deep into some expansive files and do some really neat things. This was just an example of what you can do with external files, I plan on coming back and expanding on this when I get some time. 

When you look through the code I put a few simple notes throughout it to hopefully better explain whats going on.
